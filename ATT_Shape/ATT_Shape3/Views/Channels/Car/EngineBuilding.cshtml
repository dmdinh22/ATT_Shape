Baldy Rd., where we will have lunch at the Mt.Baldy Lodge. After lunch we will visit the Mt.Baldy Visitor Center & then drive up to the top of Mt.Baldy properly named Mt. San Antonio, which is the highest peak in the San Gabriel's. Please note that this road is very scenic, very steep, so if you have a 451, I would familiarize yourself with using your paddle or floor shifter as manual mode will be required. We will have to shift into 1st gear on some of the grades. The 453's should easily conquer Mt.Baldy Rd."
